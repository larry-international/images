# mkdocs

In this directory you will find the necessary files to have [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) run in docker.

There is also an accompanying docker-compose which is what we're currently using.

## Installation

The Dockerfile assumes you already have docs located in the current directory in a folder called "docs" which contains valid mkdocs. 

Clone this repository and enter this directory

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
